    "The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models.  In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.\n",

Using the nose as the reference point may be more robust as the speaker may move relative to the video origin, so perhaps this would be a more stable feature.  The other normalized features (norm-rx etc...) is based on the position of the hand in the coordinates of the video data and not directly anchored to the speaker's own body.

    "##### Train a single word\n",
    "Now that we have built a training set with sequence data, we can \"train\" models for each word.  As a simple starting example, we train a single word using Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM).   By using the `fit` method during training, the [Baum-Welch Expectation-Maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm) (EM) algorithm is invoked iteratively to find the best estimate for the model *for the number of hidden states specified* from a group of sample seequences. For this example, we *assume* the correct number of hidden states is 3, but that is just a guess.  How do we know what the \"best\" number of states for training is?  We will need to find some model selection technique to choose the best parameter."

    "If we simply score the model with the Log Likelihood calculated from the feature sequences it has been trained on, we should expect that more complex models will have higher likelihoods. However, that doesn't tell us which would have a better likelihood score on unseen data.  The model will likely be overfit as complexity is added.  To estimate which topology model is better using only the training data, we can compare scores using cross-validation.  One technique for cross-validation is to break the training set into \"folds\" and rotate which fold is left out of training.  The \"left out\" fold scored.  This gives us a proxy method of finding the best model to use on \"unseen data\". In the following example, a set of word sequences is broken into three folds using the [scikit-learn Kfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) class object. When you implement `SelectorCV`, you will use this technique."

    "---------\n",
    "Advantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "Provides a sanity check on the performance of the model by splitting the data into training and cross-validation sets in order to gauge how the model may perform on unseen test data, by discouraging overfitted models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "One disadvantage is that, in order for the k-folds process to work, one needs at least two example sequences to create a train vs. test split.  Some of the words only had one example and therefore could not be modeled under these rules.  Other types of model selectors might be able to make use of these singletons to increase their vocabularies and possibly improve the resulting recognizer WER.\n",
    "\n",
    "SelectorBIC\n",
    "---------\n",
    "Advantages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The BIC computation has a relative speed advantage over CV, given its simplicity.  Additionally, in the current implementation it uses all of the data provided for training and determining the BIC which may give it a slight advantage in terms of robustness (compared to CV where we are forced to split the data into training and cross-validation).  The ultimate validity of this will be determined by the test accuracy, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "As compared to DIC (and as detailed in the Alain Biem reference), BIC may not be the most effective measure of model performance for classification, given that it does not directly take into account the performance of a model against other words in the vocabulary.  Additionally, it does (as currently implemented) have the potential for overfitting since a hold-out set is not used.  However, it is hoped that the model complexity term in the BIC will adequately penalize models that may have a tendency to become overfit and prevent them from being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "SelectorDIC\n",
    "---------\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "The DIC approach takes into account a lot of information about the modeling problem.  It favors those models which both do comparatively well on accepting the test word and also those models that do well in rejecting other words at the same time.  This is reportedly (in the Alain Biem reference) superior in performance to a BIC based model selection on the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:  \n",
    "\n",
    "This method adds time complexity because it requires an additional internal loop over the entire set of words in the vocabulary.  This can make it slow in model selection compared to say BIC (although this may not be a huge issue given the timing results above).  This may be a restriction for more general applicability in that if a new word is desired to be added to the set of models, the selection process requires looping over all the vocabulary already modeled.  Another factor to consider is that this method has an additional tuning parameter (alpha) which is used as some sort of \"regularizer\" to compensate for non-optimality of the estimation process (please see Biem reference).  Finding a good value for alpha would require additional exploration.  The present implementation assumes an alpha value of one, which may or may not be optimal."

    "For my three choices, I selected the \"features_polar\" set from each of the three model selection strategies.  Out of those, the best was the SelectorBIC because it has the lowest WER (0.57) and the simplest selection criteria from a time complexity consideration (as discussed in Question 2 above).  Additionally, I liked the polar result because it was also ranked highly by the other two model selection criteria (SelectorCV and SelectorDIC), which suggests the result is fairly robust no matter which method you chose to use for deciding on the model.  The entire matrix of results is shown below.\n",

    "Regarding possible routes of improvement.  As suggested in the introductory comments for Part 4, using additional context may lead to improvements.  The current recognizer treats each word in isolation, without taking into account the fact that certain words occur together more frequently.  This is the basis for n-gram models, such as bi-grams which is related to the statistics of a certain word occuring after another.  Other possible routes of investigation for improvement might include some additional exploration of the feature space.  This was touched on in the video lectures, but having a better understanding of what distinguishes each word and how effectively that is captured by the features could add some additional performance.  Examining the groups of words that are mistaken for each other in detail might suggest special discrimination rules.  However, there is probably a tradeoff that should be taken into account regarding the degree of hand-tuning vs. automatic training and expected gain when investing effort in this direction."
